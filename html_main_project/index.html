    <h1>My Favourite Movies/TV Shows</h1>
    <p>The film industry is one that has been around for genenrations, with hundreds of new movies being
    produced each month. As a result of that, many like me would agree that there are no shortages 
    of good movies and tv shows which make it hard to choose favourites.</p>

    <p>But for the sake of this presentation, I have chosen <a href="pages/movie_list.html" style="text-decoration: none;"><em>3 movies</em></a> 
    that I've really enjoyed seeing for different reasons like its theatrics, dialogue, and deep messages 
    that can be found in its well told story line.</p>
